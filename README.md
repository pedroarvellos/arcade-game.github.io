# arcade-game.github.io

Arcade Game is a project developed by me during the Advanced Front-End Nano Degree course provided by Udacity. This project demonstrates good practices at HTML 5 Canvas and JavaScript. The pure concept of the "this" context, closures and prototype is nicely demonstrated in this project. 

Access the Arcade Game: https://pedroarvellos.github.io/arcade-game.github.io/

## How to use

Download the project directly or go to a specific folder and download it by git:

`git init` 

`git clone https://github.com/pedroarvellos/arcade-game.github.io.git`

The project can be opened in any text editor, for example: _Sublime Text_, _Visual Studio_,  _Atom_, etc. To execute the game, it can be opened the index.html file on the browser.

## How to play

This is a simple arcade game, and to complete it, just take a look at the points:

- The enemies are the many bugs which walk along the streets.
- The goal of the character is to cross to the lake.
- If the bug touches you, you start from the scratch.
